# Movie Recommender Static Web App

This project implements a basic static web application for recommending movies based on content similarity. The recommendations are generated using a precomputed cosine similarity matrix from the MovieLens dataset. For more information and to view the code for the movie recommendation algorithm, please view the repo [here](https://github.com/dtavizondykstra/MovieLensRecommender).

## Overview

[This web app](https://black-rock-0d6f60310.5.azurestaticapps.net/) allows users to input a movie title from a pre-computed list and receive the top 10 movie recommendations based on genres, tags, movie title, and average rating.

## Features

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Uses movie genres, tags, titles, and average rating for recommendations.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Calculates similarity scores between movies.
- **Precomputed Recommendations**: Recommendations are precomputed and stored in a JSON file to save on compute and memory.

## How It Works

1. **Data Preparation**:
    - Aggregates tags and average rating for each movie,  and then combines them with the movie genre and title to create a feature set for each movie.
    - Calculates cosine similarity scores between movies.

2. **Recommendation Function**:
    - A function that takes a movie title and retrieves the top 10 similar movies based on precomputed similarity scores.

3. **Web App**:
    - A simple web interface where users can input a movie title to get recommendations.
    - Hosted on Azure Static Web Apps.

## Project Specifics

### Student Project Approach

- **Precomputed Data**:
    - For this student project, only a subset of movies is used.
    - Ten movies and their top 10 related movies are stored in a JSON file (`top_10_movies.json`).
    - This approach minimizes computational and memory requirements, making it easier to manage and deploy.

### Future Enhancements

- **Scalability**:
    - In a production-level project, recommendations could be dynamically generated by connecting to a movie API.
    - The recommendation script could run daily (e.g., at midnight) to update the recommendations.
    - Results could be stored in a NoSQL database in JSON format, allowing the web app to fetch real-time recommendations.

## Setup and Deployment

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MovieRecommenderWebApp.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```sh
    cd MovieRecommenderWebApp
    ```

3. **Start a Local Server**:
    ```sh
    python -m http.server 8000
    ```

4. **Deploy to Azure**:
    - Follow the Azure Static Web Apps setup to link your GitHub repository and deploy the app.

## Usage

- Open the web app in your browser.
- Enter a movie title to get the top 10 recommendations.

## Future Enhancements

- **Integrate Collaborative Filtering**: Improve recommendations by incorporating user behavior data.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Connect to a movie API for real-time updates.
- **Database Integration**: Store recommendation results in a NoSQL database for efficient querying and scalability.
